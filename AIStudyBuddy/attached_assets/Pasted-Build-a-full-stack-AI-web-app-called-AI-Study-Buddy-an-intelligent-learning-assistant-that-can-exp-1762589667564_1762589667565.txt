Build a full-stack AI web app called AI Study Buddy — an intelligent learning assistant that can explain, quiz, and schedule study topics for students using Replit AI integrations.

The project should focus on creativity, reasoning, and execution through intelligent agents. It should use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React preferred) for the frontend, and Flask/FastAPI or Node.js for backend AI routes. Use Replit’s built-in AI and database features where needed.

Website Pages and Logic
Landing Page (First Look)

Top Left: Logo of the web app.

Top Right: “Login” and “Sign Up” buttons.

Center: A search bar with placeholder text: "Enter your Topic" (slightly blurred).

Placeholder disappears when typing.

Login button: Redirect to /login.

Sign Up button: Redirect to /signup.
Login Page

Ask for: Email/Mobile Number and Password.

“Submit” button → verifies credentials and redirects to /home.

Signup Page

Fields for: Email ID, Mobile Number, Password Setup.

On submit → stores user credentials and redirects to /home.

Home Page (After Login/Signup)

Top Right: “My Profile” button.

Center: Search bar (same as landing).

On entering a topic and pressing “Enter”:

Redirect to /topic/:topicName.

Use Replit AI to generate main topic content divided into subtopics.

Display subtopics as clickable buttons → each leads to /subtopic/:name.

Subtopic Page (Roadmap Style)

Each subtopic contains three AI-generated sections:

Explanation: AI-generated detailed explanation.

Examples: AI-generated examples with concept-based question-style examples.

Quiz Section: Interactive multiple-choice quiz (AI-generated, easy to moderate).

Each section has Next and Previous buttons for navigation.
Quiz section has:

Radio button options

Submit button → shows correct/incorrect answer

Updates quiz stats in user profile

Profile Dashboard Page

Accessed via “My Profile” → /profile.

Include:

User info (email, mobile, etc.) displayed in styled cards.

Segmented Donut Chart showing:

Total questions attempted

Correct vs incorrect answers (from quiz results).

History Section:

Lists topics previously attempted.

Each topic clickable → opens attempted questions (only those that were submitted once).

AI + Replit Integration

Use Replit AI SDK or Ghostwriter AI endpoints to:

Generate topic content, subtopics, explanations, examples, and quizzes dynamically.

Track quiz performance and update user stats.

Store user data and quiz progress in Replit Database.

Design Guidelines

Modern, minimal UI (TailwindCSS or CSS Flexbox/Grid).

Rounded corners, soft shadows, and responsive design.

Keep a consistent color theme (e.g., #1E1E2E, #4ADE80, #A78BFA).

Smooth transitions between sections.
